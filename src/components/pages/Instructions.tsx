            The first step is to choose a plan that best suits your needs. By
            default, you will be signed up for a generous ALWAYS FREE plan that
            allows you to gauge the effectiveness of Reelife in your store. If
            you would like to upgrade, you can do so by going to the
            Subscriptions tab from the left sidebar. After selecting one, you
            will be redirected to Stripe&reg; to complete the payment process.
            Stripe&reg; is a secure payment processor that allows you to perform
            transactions securely. We do not store any of your payment
            information on our servers.
